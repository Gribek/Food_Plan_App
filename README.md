# Food_Plan_App

An application for adding recipes and creating simple eating plans.

This project was a simulation of work in the Scrum methodology, performed during Coders Lab Python back-end course. We were provided with templates, which we used to give the application basic functionalities. We carried out only one sprint (one week of work) thus it is not a fully developed project.

Technologies used: Python, Django
